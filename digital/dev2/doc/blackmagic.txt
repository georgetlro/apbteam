===========================================
 dev2 blackmagic - Black Magic Probe Debug
===========================================

The gpio mode can be used as a cheap and slow JTAG or SWD interface.

Switching to GPIO mode
======================

If you use a combined firmware, you have to switch to GPIO mode once each time
dev2 is plugged or an output is selected.

 dev2ctl.py --gpio 0 0

Building Black Magic Probe with dev2 support
============================================

This must be done once in the tools/blackmagic/src directory:

 make PROBE_HOST=dev2

How to debug an STM32
=====================

First run blackmagic with the right device:

 cd tools/blackmagic/src
 ./blackmagic -s /dev/ttyUSB1

Then in another terminal start GDB with the elf file:

 arm-none-eabi-gdb my_project.stm32f4.elf
 ...
 (gdb) target ext :2000
 Remote debugging using :2000
 (gdb) monitor swdp_scan
 Target voltage: not supported
 Available Targets:
 No. Att Driver
  1      STM32F4xx
 (gdb) attach 1
 Attached to Remote target
 0x08000710 in Hardware::wait (this=0x2001f3fc) at hardware.stm32.cc:116
 116         while (!(TIM3_SR & TIM_SR_UIF))
 (gdb)

You can then use GDB as usual:

 (gdb) load
 (gdb) run
