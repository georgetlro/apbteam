====================
 dev2 isp - AVR ISP
====================

This isp module provides an STK500v2 compatible AVR programmer.  It can be
combined with the serial module in the same firmware.

Do not forget to select an output using the control script!

Usage with avrdude
==================

This programmer is recognised as a regular STK500v2 programmer on a serial
port.

Example to access the terminal mode:

 avrdude -c stk500v2 -P /dev/ttyUSB1 -p atmega128 -t

If the AVR frequency is too loo, you may have to lower the programmer
frequency to have reliable communications:

 avrdude -c stk500v2 -P /dev/ttyUSB1 -p atmega128 -B 100 -t

To program a hex file:

 avrdude -c stk500v2 -P /dev/ttyUSB1 -p atmega128 -U flash:w:foobar.hex
