===============================================================
 dev2 - Multi-purpose development board using USB and Ethernet
===============================================================

USB connection
==============

As there is no driver for the dev2 board in the kernel and there is not enough
USB end points in the AT90USB162 to implement a ACM class device with two
serial ports, you should load the generic serial driver:

 modprobe usbserial vendor=0x03eb product=0x204e

Then look at kernel messages to locate the new serial devices (/dev/ttyUSBx).

Controlling the output
======================

The board can be controlled using the dev2ctl.py program which uses libusb.

Use it to select an output.

You can also use it to deselect an output so that no current flows into it.

It can also be used to control GPIO when available in the loaded firmware.

About the vendor and product ID
===============================

They come from LUFA, the USB library we use for dev2.  This is not supposed to
be done in a commercial USB product, but this is OK for hobbyists.  That's why
dev2ctl parses the product name to make sure it talks to the right device.
