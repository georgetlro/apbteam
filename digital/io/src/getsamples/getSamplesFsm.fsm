Events:
 position_reached

GO_TO_POSITION:
 position_reached -> PREPARE_ARM
  Go to the position desired, it is very near the position of the distributor in case it is a ice distributor or sample distributor.
 position_failed -> GO_TO_POSITION
  Go to another point before trying to go to this one again.

PREPARE_ARM:
 arm_moved -> FORWARD_CONTROL
  Prepare the arm to the correct position.

FORWARD_CONTROL:
 position_reached -> TAKE_SAMPLES
  End the position to the distributor.

TAKE_SAMPLES:
 sample_took: nb_samples < quantity -> .
  Continue to take samples and classify the next sample.
 sample_took: nb_samples == quantity -> BACKWARD
  If the quantity of samples are tooked, then go backeward and conitnue classifying the samples.

BACKWARD:
 position_reached -> END
  Ending this state machine.
