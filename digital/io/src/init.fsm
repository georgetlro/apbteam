# init FSM
# This FSM set the position of the bot with some move on wall
# This FSM is required because the meca team is "relou"
init
  init FSM with setup move

States:
 IDLE
  waiting for the beginning of the top FSM
 WAIT_JACK_IN
  waiting for the jack to be inserted into the bot.
  get color for the rest of the FSM.
  erase flash.
 WAIT_2_SEC [timeout=450]
  waiting for operator's hand not on jack anymore
 GOTO_THE_WALL
  go to the wall for the first time
 GO_BACKWARD
  go backward for INIT_DIST millimeters
 TURN_90_DEGREES_CCW
  turn bot for 90 degrees counterclockwise
 GOTO_THE_WALL_AGAIN
  go to the wall for the second time
 GO_BACKWARD_AGAIN
  go backward for INIT_DIST millimeters again
 TURN_180_DEGREES_CCW
  turn bot for 180 degrees counterclockwise
 SET_POSITION
  tell the truth to asserv

Events:
 start
  initialize the FSM
 jack_inserted_into_bot
  the jack is inserted into the bot
 move_done
  the move is finished
 state_timeout
  timeout.
 asserv_last_cmd_ack
  last command sent to the asserv board acquited.

IDLE:
 start -> WAIT_JACK_IN
  wait for the jack to be inserted into the bot

WAIT_JACK_IN:
 jack_inserted_into_bot -> WAIT_2_SEC
  wait for the operator hand disappears

WAIT_2_SEC:
 state_timeout -> GOTO_THE_WALL
  go to the first wall

GOTO_THE_WALL:
 move_done -> GO_BACKWARD
  go backward for INIT_DIST millimeters

GO_BACKWARD:
 move_done -> TURN_90_DEGREES_CCW
  turn bot for 90 degrees counterclockwise

TURN_90_DEGREES_CCW:
 move_done -> GOTO_THE_WALL_AGAIN
  go to the wall for the second time

GOTO_THE_WALL_AGAIN:
 move_done -> GO_BACKWARD_AGAIN
  go backward for INIT_DIST millimeters again

GO_BACKWARD_AGAIN:
 move_done -> SET_POSITION
  set real position to asserv

SET_POSITION:
 asserv_last_cmd_ack -> IDLE
  turn bot for 180 degrees counterclockwise
