Introduction
============

This module will bind together several layers of motor control modules.  It
aims at helping sequencing them in the right order to meets real time
constrains and state changes sequence required order.

Usage
=====

You should use one of `control_system_single_t` for a single motor system, or
`control_system_polar_t` for a dual motor differential robot configuration.
The encoder and output structures should be initialised and their pointers be
set before the `control_system_*_init` is called.

The `control_system_*_update_prepare` function should be called right before
you wait for the next cycle, but after you made changes to consigns.  Once the
next cycle start, as fast as possible, you should first update encoders, then
call the `control_system_*_update` function, and finally update outputs.

This is important that consigns (and control state) are not changed between
update preparation and update, because the update function is also responsible
to reset some internal variables when state is changed.
