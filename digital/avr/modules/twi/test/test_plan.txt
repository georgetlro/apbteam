Test slave will update its slave send buffer with received data from master.
Read slave buffer after each transmission.

 - master send 1 byte.
 - master send n bytes, less than slave limit.
 - master send n bytes, same as slave limit.
 - master send n bytes, more than slave limit.
   > should be interrupted at slave limit.
 - master send 0 byte.
   > master can send 0 byte, but test slave should not update slave send
   > buffer as 0 is forbidden.

 - master recv 0 byte.
   > will receive a byte anyway.
 - master recv 1 byte.
 - with slave buffer size 1 and m:
   - master recv n byte, less than slave limit.
   - master recv n byte, same as slave limit.
   - master recv n byte, more than slave limit.
     > can not be interrupted, will read 0xff.
