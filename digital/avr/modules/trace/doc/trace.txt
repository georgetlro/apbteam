Trace module
============

The trace module is in charge to store data in the flash memory.

Description
-----------

The flash memory used is a 16 Mbit SPI flash memory SST25VF016B.
The objective of this module is to use the flash memory as circular buffer to
store events which had occurred in the robot during the match by storing data
with a unique identifier for each event and the data following this id.

Depends
-------

This module depends on the following ones:

  * Flash
  * SPI
  * Utils

Module
------

1. The Trace module start to initialise the flash memory and read the status of this one.

  1.1  It gets the address of the first sector available of the flash.

  1.2  Gets the next sector address of the flash memory, and erase it if it is not empty.

  1.3  Store a start code useful to know the beginning of last traces.

2. TRACE macro.

The trace macro as for job to compute for each parameter it as the length of
those ones (1, 2, 4 bytes) and store it in the flash memory.

The only thing the actor as to do is to call the TRACE macro as follow:

uint8_t val1;

uint16_t val2;

...

TRACE (val1, val2, ...)

3. The uninitialise function of the trace module shall be called to store the end code of traces.
