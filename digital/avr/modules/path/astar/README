avr.path.astar - A* path finding module.

Path finding in a user provided graph.  One of the main idea behind this
module is to be able to operate with a minimum memory footprint even with a
large number of nodes.

This can be useful with a grid based graph, where there is many nodes, but not
so many arcs, and arc weight (which are not stored by this module) can be
computed quickly.

This module use an indexed nodes storage, therefore, memory consumption is
O(n), with n the number of nodes.  For very large grids, another
implementation could be done where unused nodes are not stored in memory.
