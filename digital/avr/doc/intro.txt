 AVR Modules Introduction
==========================
:Author: Ni

AVR modules is a set of small and simple reusable modules to make it easier to
program a robot using AVR microcontrollers.

It is currently only tested under Linux, using the GCC compiler for both host
and target compilation.

If you are running Debian, you will need:

- gcc-avr,
- avr-libc,
- gcc, make and other classic development packages...

And you will probably need:

- avrdude, to program the AVR chips,
- gdb-avr and avarice, if you plan to use a JTAG connection,
- simulavr to run simulated algorithms.

This directory is populated with general documentation.  You can find further
help in the modules directories and in the source code.
