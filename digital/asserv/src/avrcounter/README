avrcounter - Incremental encoder counter on AVR microcontroller.

Microcontrolers often have counter inputs, but they do not have any dedicated
inputs for incremental encoders which are therefore tendious to decode without
any external logic.

The avrcounter implements this decoder in an AVR which must be dedicated to
this task.  The number of encoders which can be decoded this way depends on the
encoders maximum frequency.  More encoders means more instruction to decode,
and lower maximum frequency.
