Lol-v2 TWI Test Tool
******************************************

! This test tool must be used with beacon/pcb/lol-v2 hardware only !

1/ Purpose of the twi test tool
Validate the hardware compliancy of the TWI bus using lol-v2 as a slave

2/ How to check lol-v2 -> Master communication
Using the APB TWI protocol, the twi test tool will always returns following fields: 
Opponent1_X = 13
Opponent1_Y = 37
Opponent1_trust = 42
Opponent2_X = 1500
Opponent2_Y = 1671
Opponent2_trust = 99

If you get theses values, TWI is unitary functional. Don't forget to check stress and robustness.

3/ How to check Master -> lol-v2 communication
Using the APB TWI protocol, the twi test tool will light on all the leds when the jack field is set to 1 by the master. Inversely, leds will be shutted down when jack field is set to 0.
