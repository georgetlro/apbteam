io-hub - Modular Input/Output.

The io-hub, and its daughter boards (the spoke boards) can be assembled to make
a modular IO system.  The io-hub contains a microcontroller which can be
connected using TWI, serial port or USB to the rest of the system.  It
provides a set of standard ten pin connectors to connect spoke boards.  Spoke
boards are equipped with connectors adapted to specific needs, along with some
optional adaptation electronic.
