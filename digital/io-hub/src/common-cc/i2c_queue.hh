/// Handle communication as a master to several slaves.
///
/// The communication protocol is always based on:
///  - a message sent to the slave with a command to execute,
///  - a status read from the slave containing the current slave state.
///
/// The first byte of all messages is a CRC of the following bytes.
///
/// The next byte is the command sequence number.  It is used by the master to
/// know if its command has been handled.  The last handled command sequence
/// number is available in the slave status.
///
/// All other bytes are the message payload.
///
/// As long as the slave last command sequence number is not equal to the last
/// sent sequence number, the master can not send any other command.  If the
/// slave do not acknowledge the command after a time out, the command is sent
/// again.
///
/// Several commands can be stored by this class, it will defer their
/// transmission until the first command is acknowledged.
///
/// This class also support unreliable transient command delivery.  There can
/// be only one transient command per slave and it is sent only if the slave
/// is synchronised.
/// 
/// There can be slaves which do not use this protocol.  In this case, the
/// message is sent without any CRC or acknowledgement support.
