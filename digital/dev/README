dev - development board based on USBProg.

This board is supposed to support several development task:

 - AVR microcontroller programming,
 - AVR JTAG debugger,
 - CPLD programming,
 - serial port connection.

We do not use this board any longer for future development because upstream
code is very buggy, and messy (svn without commit messages, with binaries,
multiple copies of the almost same code...).  We never tried to make the JTAG
part work.

Please see our dev2 board.
