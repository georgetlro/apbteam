Boards
======

IO:
    Input/Output board. It acquires information from sensors (switches, IR
    distance detectors, color sensors...) and it controls actuators (servo
    motors, auxiliary motors...).

    The main component is an AVR, surrounded by many connectors.
AI:
    Artificial intelligence board, may optionally be merged with IO board.  It
    runs the robot automaton and decision algorithms.
    
    The main component is an AVR, as the board is the same as the IO one.  It
    contains a flash memory to record the decisions taken by the robot.
Asserv:
    Motor control board.  Run the algorithms to control robot movement and
    position.

    An AVR runs the control logic, and a programmable logic component (an
    XC9572, a CPLD from Xilinx) computes the encoders positions.
Motor Power:
    It applies consigns from the Asserv board to the motors.  An AVR is
    responsible to control the current sunk in the motors and a owned-built
    H-bridge drive the power.

Communications
==============

IÂ²C:
    High level communication bus between boards.  The AI board is the master
    of this bus.
SPI:
    The motor power board is connected using a serial high speed bus.
PWM:
    Pulse Width Modulation used to drive the motors.
Quadrature:
    Raw signal given by the encoders to determine rotation steps and direction.
AVR ISP:
    Used to program the AVR microcontrollers.
AVR JTAG:
    Used for in circuit debugging.
DEBUG UART:
    Used for debug control and diagnostic messages.
CPLD JTAG:
    Used to program the CPLD.
