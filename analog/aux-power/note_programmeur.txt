SIGNAL TRANSITION REQUIREMENTS
To ensure proper internal logic performance, it is good prac-
tice to avoid aligning the falling and rising edges of input sig-
nals. A delay of at least 1 µsec should be incorporated be-
tween transitions of the Direction, Brake, and/or PWM input
signals. A conservative approach is be sure there is at least
500ns delay between the end of the first transition and the
beginning of the second transition.
